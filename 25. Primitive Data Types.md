## Primitive Data Types in ZigC
  
By default you can use all basic data types from Zig language. Some C types are added just for friendliness.

In Zig and ZigC there's no 'unsigned' keyword, instead, you have two separate types, 'i32' for signed integer and 'u32' for unsigned integer.
  
## Zig primitive types
  
* Signed integers: i8, i16, i32, ... i128
* Unsigned integers: u8, u16, ... u128
* Floating numbers: f16, ... f128
* Boolean: bool
* Pointer sized integer: isize, usize
* C compatible types: c_int, c_ushort, c_longlong, ...

Note that there is no 'char' nor 'c_char'. There's no clear and widely accepted idea about what a 'char' should be. 

?? Go language 'rune' ???

## Other Zig primitive types

There are some primitive types that needs not detailed explanation here.
  
* anyopaque, void, noreturn, type, anyerror, comptime_int, comptime_float

Note that 'type' itself is a first citizen type in Zig, and it plays an important role for generic constructor functions.
  
## Arbirtary length integers

Zig provides a very special kinds of integers, with arbitrary bit width, up to 65535.

* i1, i2, i3, i7, ... i65535
* u1, u2, u3, ... u65535
  
## A few ZigC alias types for friendliness
  
ZigC provides following aliases only for friendliness purpose.
  
* int == i32
* byte == u8
* float == f32
* ?? char == u8
* size_t == usize
  
## Zig primitive values

* true, false, null, undefined

## Zig integer literals
  
* numerals: -50_000
* hexadecimals: 0xff, 0xff_03_3a_00
* octal: 0o755, 0o6_4_4
* binary: 0b1011, 0b1_0_1_1

## Zig float literals
  
* 123.0E+77
* 123.0
* 123.0e+12
* 0x103.70p-5
* 0x103.70
* 0x103.70P-5
  
Underscores may be placed between two digits as a visual separator.

* 299_792_458.000_000
* 0.000_000_001
* 0x1234_5678.9ABC_CDEFp-10
  
There is no syntax for NaN, infinity, or negative infinity. For these special values, one must use the standard library.

```
import std;

const inf = std.math.inf(f32);
const negative_inf = -std.math.inf(f64);
const nan = std.math.nan(f128);
```
