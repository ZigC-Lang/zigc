# Test blocks in ZigC

ZigC inherites extensive and elegant test features from Zig language without any modification.
  
## Test blocks in Zig
  
Zig's elegant test framework is extensive and extremely configurable. Followings are test features:
  
* simple test declaration
* nested container test
* skip test
* test build
* test logging
  
## Zig test block syntax
  
Test block is a simple block of statements, starting from 'test' keyword. Test blocks may have descriptive names in double qouted string.
  
```
test {
  // statements...;
}
test "descriptive test name" {
  // statements...;
}
```
  
Test may be scoped within containers like 'enum', 'struct' or 'union'.
  
**ZigC**
```
from std.testing import expect;

test {
    _ = S;
    _ = U;
}

struct S {
    test "S demo test" {
        try expect(true);
    }

    enum SE {
        V,
        test "This Test Won't Run" {
            try expect(false);
        }
    };
};

union U {
    US s;

    struct US {
        test "U.US demo test" {
            try expect(true);
        }
    };

    test "U demo test" {
        try expect(true);
    }
};
```
   
Note that two kinds of omissions are happening in the assignment statement `_ = S;`. Underbar is a special variable name, aka. ignorance variable, and it never causes an 'unused variable error'. On the left side, type name is omitted because type is clearly known as  'struct S'. On the right side, value initialization is omitted because there's no member variable in struct S. So the full assignment statement is `S _ = S{};`.
  
Note the subtle difference of comma ',' separation in enum declaration, and semicolon ';' separation in struct/union declaration, which is the same in C language.
  
Note that test's descriptive name needs to reflex the surrounding container name, or if not, test is not triggered.
  

**Zig**
```
const expect = @import("std.testing").expect;

test {
    _ = S;
    _ = U;
}

const S = struct {
    test "S demo test" {
        try expect(true);
    }

    const SE = enum {
        V,

        test "This Test Won't Run" {
            try expect(false);
        }
    };
};

const U = union { 
    s: US, 

    const US = struct {
        test "U.US demo test" {
            try expect(true);
        }
    };

    test "U demo test" {
        try expect(true);
    }
};
```
  
 Note that members or elements in containers (struct, union, and enum) are all separated by comma ','.
