# Arrays in ZigC

Arrays in ZigC are completely same as arrays in Zig, with some minor differences in syntax.
  
**ZigC**
```
const a1 = byte[5]{ 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' };
const byte[5] a2 = { 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' };
const a3 = byte[]{ 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' };
const byte[] a4 = { 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' };
const byte[] a5 = byte[]{ 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' };
const byte[5] a6 = byte[5]{ 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' };
```
  
These are all same initialized by five bytes. Note that all characters are stored in unsigned 8-bit integer(byte) of ASCII encoding.
  
Note that data type (`byte[]` or `byte[5]`) can be omitted if it is clearly determined by the context.
  
**C**
```
const char a2[5] = { 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' };
const char a4[] = { 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' };
```
  
Note that ZigC does not allow this kind of syntax -- array brackets(`[5] and []`) after variable name, not type name. Array brackets must come right after type name with no blanks in between. `byte []` and `byte[ 5]` are are rejected in ZigC, because they have a blank.
  
**Zig**
```
const a1 = [5]u8{ 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' };
const a2: [5]u8 = .{ 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' };
const a3 = [_]u8{ 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' };
const a4: [_]u8 = .{ 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' };
const a5: [_]u8 = [_]u8{ 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' };
const a6: [5]u8 = [5]u8{ 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' };
```
  
In Zig laguage, you don't have familiar types like `int, float, byte`. You can use `i32, f32, u8` instead.
  
Note that array size can be specified by  underbar `_` and the Zig compiler determines correct size.
  
Note that you have to put a dot in front of unnamed curly braced list `.{ }`. In this case, unnamed braced list's resultant type is clearly array `[_]` or `[5]`, but when result type is not determined or `anytype` then unnamed brace `.{ }` should be regarded as `struct { }` and it can contain heterogeneous items in Zig.
  
**ZigC**
```
from std.debug import assert;

const message = byte[]{ 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' };

comptime {
    assert(message.len == 5);
}
```
  
Note that ZigC array has length property `.len` and it is fixed at compile time if initial values are given.
  
Note that `comptime` block statements are evaluated at compile time, rather than in run time. `comptime` is a clever invention of ZigC. You want to optimize the computations and you may mark some part of trivial computation to be calculated at `comptime` so that run-time execution takes less time.
  
**Zig**
```
const assert = @import("std").debug.assert;

const message = [_]u8{ 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' };

comptime {
    assert(message.len == 5);
}
```

In ZigC, a "double quoted string literal" is an immutable pointer to a null-terminated byte array `const byte[*:0]`, which also acts like an array enabling direct access to elements by array indexing `[i]`.
  
**ZigC**
```
from std.debug import assert:
from std import mem;

const msg1 = byte[]{ 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' };
const msg2 = "hello"; // type: const byte[*:0]

comptime {
     assert(mem.eql(byte, &msg1, msg2));
}
```
  
Note the subtle difference from C language array which is mere a sequence, and it cannot provide boundary checking because array itself does not have `.len` property. ZigC array is a slightly abstracted one with a sequence of items plus `.len` property. This causes a significant difference in C 'string' and ZigC 'string'.
  
**C**
```
char *msg0 = char[]{'h', 'e', 'l', 'l','o'}; // not null terminated sequence
char msg1[5] = {'h', 'e', 'l', 'l','o'}; // not null terminated sequence
char *msg2 = "hello"; // null terminated sequence
char ch = 'h';
char *p = &ch; // pointer to a single char
char *q = &msg0[0]; // pointer to the first char
```
  
In this small piece of C code, there are several dangerous misconcepts and misleadings.
  
Variable `msg1` is an array `char[5]` and is also regarded as a pointer `char*` like `msg0`, which is theoretically different. `msg1[6]` is not prohibited by compiler and even worse `*(msg1+6)` is allowed and it becomes extremely hard to detect this kind of flaw in the wild real world situation.
  
`msg2`and `p` have same type marker `char *`, but these two are completely different -- the one points to a null terminated sequence and the other points to a single chararacter. 

Note that `msg0` and `q` are completely same indistinguishable, whereas the writer's intent is seemingly different.
  
So seemingly similar kind of types (`char *[]` in C and `byte[*:0]` in ZigC) could mean completely different, the one is regarded as multiple strings, and the other is regarded as a pointer to a single string. Multiple strings in ZigC is `byte[][*:0]`.
  
**Zig**
```
const assert = @import("std").debug.assert;
const mem = @import("std").mem;

const msg1 = [_]u8{ 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' };
const msg2 = "hello"; // type: const [*:0]u8

comptime {
    assert(mem.eql(u8, &message, same_message));
}
```
