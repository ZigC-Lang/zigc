# Names of Variables and Functions

ZigC inherites Zig's name syntax.
  
## Zig's variable names

Zig source should be written in UTF-8 encoded text. 
  
A name must start with an alphabet or an underscore('_'). After that, alphabets, digits, or underscores can follow.

## Zig's keywords
  
There are a set of basic keywords, that you cannot use as names.

* align, allowzero, and, anyframe, anytype, asm, async, await, break, catch, comptime, const, continue, defer, else, enum, errdefer, error, export, extern, ~fn~, for, if, inline, noalias, nosuspend, or, orelse, packed, ~pub~, resume, return, linksection, struct, suspend, switch, test, threadlocal, try, union, unreachable, usingnamespace, ~var~, volatile, ~while~.
  
Some of them are not ZigC's keywords, because they are not used in ZigC.
  
* ZigC's non-keywords: fn, pub, var, while

However you cannot use these words as variable names in ZigC, because the ZigC codes are to be transpiled into Zig codes and get compiled by Zig compiler. When eventually ZigC compiler becomes standalone, then these words could be used as variable name. 

ZigC adds some words as keywords as follows.

* ZigC's keywords: public, static, case, default, in, from, import

You cannot use these as variable names in ZigC language.


  
## Zig's special names

For compatibility issue or any other issue, you could need to use some name that violates rules metioned above, then you can use special name  formulation -- @"special name"

* keyword case: @"error"
* number starting: @"6color"
* non alpha numeric: @"7.5va tro"
  

**ZigC**
```
const @"identifier with spaces in it" = 0xff;
const @"1SmallStep4Man" = 112358;
const int @"var name" = 12;

from std import c;
public extern "c" void @"error"();
public extern "c" c_int @"fstat$INODE64"(c.fd_t fd, c.Stat* fd);

enum Color {
  red,
  @"really red",
};
const Color color = @"really red";
```
  
Note that you can have variable names, that have blanks, or that starts with a digit.

Note that you can omit type name on the left side of assignment, if the type of right hand side is clearly decided. S o `x = 0xff;` is equivalent to `int x = 0xff;`

Note that `error()` in `std.c` package needs to be name-specialized as `@"error"()` because 'error' is a keyword in ZigC.
  
Note the position of the pointer type marker `*` in `c.Stat* fd`. In ZigC, '*' comes right after type name without blanks. C style `c.Stat *fd` is not allowed in ZigC, that is a source of confusion for beginners.

Note the tail comma ',' within enum block. In C enum, it's regarded as syntax error, but accumulated wisdom clearly says that the tailing comma helps keeping sanity of developers.
  
Note that 'enum' is not required when you are using a declared enum. `Color a = red;` is sufficient, rather than `enum Color a = red;`, which is the case in C.

**Zig**
```
const @"identifier with spaces in it" = 0xff;
const @"1SmallStep4Man" = 112358;
const @"var name": i32 = 12;

const c = @import("std").c;
pub extern "c" fn @"error"() void;
pub extern "c" fn @"fstat$INODE64"(fd: c.fd_t, buf: *c.Stat) c_int;

const Color = enum {
  red,
  @"really red",
};
const color: Color = .@"really red";
```
  
Note that you need a dot '.' in front of enum value. In Zig language, you need to put a dot '.' in front of all member variables from 'enum', 'struct' or 'union'.
