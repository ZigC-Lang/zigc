# Syntax Principle of ZigC

ZigC's primary goal is to care ergonomics of developers by providing **simple**, elegant, intuitive, and **familiar** syntax, all on top of the innovative language of Zig.
  
Performance, security, scalability and adaptibility are not ZigC's primary concern. These are all up to the underlying language of Zig. The Zig language claimes to be the modern successor of the good old language of C, and ZigC starts from this claim.

Followings are how ZigC syntax is formulated:
  
* shoul be most comfortable for C programmers.
* should accommodate all modern syntax introduced by Zig, but in more C-like way.
* should take simplist form, comparing among other modern languages.
* should guarrantee zero overhead on Zig, which also guarrantees zero overhead on C.
* may take away unnecessary details from Zig, if possible.
* may compromise rigid rules, if it helps programmer's happyness.
* may slightly sacrifice compile time, if it helps programmer's sanity.
