# Installation of ZigC language

ZigC's top most goal is to be as friendly as possible, so it can be installed using whatever package managers out there in the world.
  
For most popular language users:  
  
* Python: pip install ZigC
* Javascript: npm install ZigC
  
For Linux users:  
  
* Ubuntu: apt install ZigC
* Redhat: yum install ZigC
  
For Mac and Rust users:

* brew install ZigC
* cargo install ZigC

  
Eventually ZigC will be available on every single system on earth.
