# Anonymous Container Literals 

Similar to Enum Literals and Anonymous Struct Literals, the type can be omitted from array literals '{ }`.
  
**ZigC**
```
from std.testing import expect;

test "anonymous list literal syntax" {
    byte[4] array = {11, 22, 33, 44};
    try expect(array[0] == 11);
    try expect(array[1] == 22);
    try expect(array[2] == 33);
    try expect(array[3] == 44);
}
```

Note the array type marker `[4]` comes right after `byte`. C style declaration `byte array[4] = {11, 22, 33, 44};` is not allowed.
  
**Zig**
```
const std = @import("std");
const expect = std.testing.expect;

test "anonymous list literal syntax" {
    var array: [4]u8 = .{11, 22, 33, 44};
    try expect(array[0] == 11);
    try expect(array[1] == 22);
    try expect(array[2] == 33);
    try expect(array[3] == 44);
}
```
  
In Zig, a new variable is introduced by `var` keyword. If the value of the variable is to remain the same then starting with `const` instead is better choice, because of optimization. 

In Zig, data type specification `: [4]u8` follows after variable name, meaning array of four unsigned 8-bit integers (bytes).
  
In Zig, anonymous container literal starts by a dot `.{ }`.
  
## Anonymous Struct Literals
  
If there is no type in the result location then an anonymous list literal actually turns into a struct with *numbered field names*.
  
**ZigC**
```
from std.testing import expect;

test "fully anonymous list literal" {
    try dump({ @as(u32, 1234), @as(f64, 12.34), true, "hi"});
}

void! dump(anytype args) {
    try expect(args.@"0" == 1234);
    try expect(args.@"1" == 12.34);
    try expect(args.@"2");
    try expect(args.@"3"[0] == 'h');
    try expect(args.@"3"[1] == 'i');
}
```
  
The function `dump()` gets an indefinite `anytype`, so the unnamed container `{ @as(u32, 1234), @as(f64, 12.34), true, "hi"}` becomes `struct` by default  and each member gets numbered field names like "0", "1", "2", ... In this case, they violate the variable naming rule, which does not allow digits for the first character of variable names. ZigC provides a special naming escape rule `@"special varable name"`. That's why the anonymous struct's member names became `@"0", @"1", @"2", ...`.
  
Note the `!` mark after `void`, which shows that `dump()` function could possibly return an error, because  `expect()` function might return an error. 



**Zig**
```
const std = @import("std");
const expect = std.testing.expect;

test "fully anonymous list literal" {
    try dump(.{ @as(u32, 1234), @as(f64, 12.34), true, "hi"});
}

fn dump(args: anytype) !void {
    try expect(args.@"0" == 1234);
    try expect(args.@"1" == 12.34);
    try expect(args.@"2");
    try expect(args.@"3"[0] == 'h');
    try expect(args.@"3"[1] == 'i');
}
```
