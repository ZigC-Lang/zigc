# main() and C standard functions
  
In ZigC, you have all C standard functions with little changes in parameter types, provided in Zig's `std.c` package. These can be called in exactly same format, even without any package import. These basic functions should give a friendly impression to new commers.
  
* main(), printf(), strcpy(), ...
  
**ZigC**
```
void main() {
    printf("Hello %s!\n", "World");
}
```
  
Note that you don't have to import `std.c`, because ZigC is a C language, `std.c` is automatically imported.
  

**Zig**
```
const std = @import("std");
pub fn main() !void {
    std.c.printf("Hello %s!\n", .{"World"});
    std.debug.print("Hello {s}!\n", .{"World"});
}
```

## Note some differences.
   
* 'main()' is public by default, and you do not have to mark as `public void main()`.
* no 'fn' keyword, and return type comes first ahead of function name.
* Zig 'std.debug.print()' returns error, and error escalation is marked as '!'. '!void' is shorter form of 'anyerror!void' in Zig.
* ZigC's basic C function 'printf()' does not return an error and bare 'void' is enough in this case.
* Zig's variadic arguments to 'std.debug.print()' are packed in a sequence '.{ }', with a dot in front of curly braces.
  
This Zig code does not compile by ZigC compiler, due to 'fn', '!' and '.{ }'. 
  
Zig-like call is also possible but it must be in ZigC convention.
  
**ZigC**
```
const std = @import("std");
void! main() {
    std.debug.print("Hello {s}!\n", "World");
}
```

In ZigC, `void!` is a composite type, which is a shorcut of `void!anyerror`, meaning that 'main()' function returns either 'void' or 'anyerror'. Error type comes after '!', and it cannot be ommited if the function returns any error. Note the difference of order between Zig's 'anyerror!void' and ZigC's 'void!anyerror' -- primary 'void' comes first and optional '!anyerror' follows, and that's more meaningful, because 'main()' returns 'void' **or** 'error'.
  
Note again that ZigC's variadic arguments are not enclosed by anonymous struct '.{ }'.
  
ZigC guarantees zero overhead, on top of Zig language. So ZigC style coding is always preferable if possible, because that's more comprehensible to the broader range of developers.
