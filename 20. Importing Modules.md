# Importing modules
  
In ZigC, you can write Python style import syntax.
  
**ZigC**
```
import std;
from std.testing import expect;
```
**Zig**
```
const std = @import("std");
const expect = @import("std").expect;
```
  
There is no #include header files and no #define macros.
  
You can still use Zig style imports, specifically in importing C language headers. Python style import is always recommended if possible.
  
**ZigC**
```
const std = @import("std");
const expect = std.testing.expect;

const c = @cImport({
    // See https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/515
    @cDefine("_NO_CRT_STDIO_INLINE", "1");
    @cInclude("stdio.h");

const sqlite = @cImport({
    @cInclude("sqlite3.h");
    @cInclude("my_sqlite_extension.h");
    @cDefine("MY_SQLITE_EXTENSION");
    @cInclude("another_extension.h");
    @cLib("sqlite3");
});
```
  
Note that Zig and ZogC provides special built-in functions for C compatibility, '@cImport(), @cInclude(), @cDefine(), @cLib()'.
  

## Source code import is not allowed
  
Zig language allows importing a source code directly.
  
**Zig**
```
const my_test = @import("my_test.zig");
```
  
ZigC does not allow direct source code import, even if you're using Zig-style `@import()`.
  
**ZigC**
```
const my_test = @import("my_test.zc"); // compile error
```
  
In this case, "my_test.zc" is regarded as a module/package name, and ZigC transpiler emits "No such module/package error".  
  
This is because of the relation between ZigC and Zig. ZigC transpiles into Zig code and does not touch anything witin double quoted string. Zig compiler knows nothing about ZigC code and in result Zig compiler would reject ".zc" files. This would be eventually solved if ZigC itself becomes standalone and independant from Zig compiler
  
Note that the extention of ZigC source file is ".zc".
