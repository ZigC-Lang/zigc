# Opaque
  

`opaque {}` declares a new type with an unknown (but non-zero) size and alignment. It can contain declarations the same as structs, unions, and enums.
  
This is typically used for type safety when interacting with C code that does not expose struct details.
  

**ZigC**
```
opaque Derp {};
opaque Wat {};

extern void bar(Derp* d);
void foo(Wat* w) callconv(C) {
    bar(w);
}

test "call foo" {
    foo(undefined);
}
```
  
**Zig**
```
const Derp = opaque {};
const Wat = opaque {};

extern fn bar(d: *Derp) void;
fn foo(w: *Wat) callconv(.C) void {
    bar(w);
}

test "call foo" {
    foo(undefined);
}
```
